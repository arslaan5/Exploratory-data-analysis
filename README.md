# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

## Overview

This repository contains various projects where I conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on different datasets. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, allowing us to understand the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses through visualization and summary statistics.

## Projects Included

1. **[Zomato EDA](https://github.com/arslaan5/Exploratory-data-analysis/tree/main/Zomato)**  
   Analyzing Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, ratings, popular cuisines, and online delivery availability.

More EDA projects will be added as the repository grows.

## Structure

- Each project in this repository has its own directory containing:
  - The dataset used (or a link to the dataset)
  - Jupyter Notebook(s) with the EDA process
  - Visualizations and insights from the analysis
  - A README file specific to each project detailing the objectives and findings
