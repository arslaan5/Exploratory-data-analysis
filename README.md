# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

## Overview

This repository contains various projects where I conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on different datasets. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, allowing us to understand the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses through visualization and summary statistics.

## Projects Included

1. **[Zomato EDA](https://github.com/arslaan5/Exploratory-data-analysis/tree/main/Zomato)**  
   Analyzing Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, ratings, popular cuisines, and online delivery availability.

2. **[Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploration](https://github.com/arslaan5/Exploratory-data-analysis/tree/main/Layoffs)**  
   Cleaning and exploring a dataset on corporate layoffs to identify trends in layoffs by company, industry, and country, as well as the total number of employees laid off over time.

More EDA projects will be added as the repository grows.

## Structure

- Each project in this repository has its own directory containing:
  - The dataset used (or a link to the dataset)
  - Jupyter Notebook(s) with the EDA process
  - Visualizations and insights from the analysis
  - A README file specific to each project detailing the objectives and findings
